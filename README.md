Task: Impact of Environmental Factors on Plant Growth

Objective
The task aims to explore how environmental factors such as temperature and light intensity affect plant growth. The objective is to analyze the relationship between environmental conditions and plant growth, and visualize trends in the data.

Tasks
1. Data Preparation
o Load a CSV file containing data on environmental conditions and plant growth into a pandas DataFrame.
o Clean the data by handling missing values and ensuring appropriate data types for each column.
o Display basic summary statistics, including the first few rows and the summary of numerical columns.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
o Visualize the distribution of plant growth under varying temperature and light conditions using histograms or box plots.

o Plot scatter plots to visually inspect the relationship between temperature and plant growth, and light intensity and plant growth.

4. Correlation Analysis
o Compute and visualize the correlation matrix between temperature, light intensity, and plant growth to check for any significant relationships.

o Investigate which environmental factor (temperature or light intensity) has the strongest correlation with plant growth.

6. Linear Regression
o Perform a linear regression analysis to determine how temperature and light intensity influence plant growth.
o Visualize the regression results and the best-fit line for both temperature and light intensity.

8. Trend Analysis (optional)
o Plot a time series graph to show how plant growth changes over time with respect to temperature and light intensity.
